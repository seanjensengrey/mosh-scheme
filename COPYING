   SRFI-1 list-processing library 			-*- Scheme -*-
   Reference implementation

   Copyright (c) 1998, 1999 by Olin Shivers. You may do as you please with
   this code as long as you do not remove this copyright notice or
   hold me liable for its use. Please send bug reports to shivers@ai.mit.edu.

   This is a library of list- and pair-processing functions. I wrote it after
   carefully considering the functions provided by the libraries found in
   R4RS/R5RS Scheme, MIT Scheme, Gambit, RScheme, MzScheme, slib, Common
   Lisp, Bigloo, guile, T, APL and the SML standard basis. It is a pretty
   rich toolkit, providing a superset of the functionality found in any of
   the various Schemes I considered.

   This implementation is intended as a portable reference implementation
   for SRFI-1. See the porting notes below for more information.
