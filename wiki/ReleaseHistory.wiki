#summary Release log


 * 2010/5/15 : *0.2.5 released *
  * [http://mosh-scheme.googlecode.com/files/mosh-0.2.5-1.tar.gz mosh-0.2.5-1.tar.gz]
  * This release introduces "nmosh" another R6RS environment.
  * Changes
    * Introduce nmosh by OKUMURA Yuki. nmosh is a port of Andre van Tonder's R6RS macro and runtime[1] and R6RS record from Larceny[2] with additional expander-cache (ACC) and debugging feature such as runtime stack trace. Although nmosh is intended to a drop-in replacement of previous psyntax based mosh, it is still lacks some mosh specific enhancements against R6RS standard such as SRFI-38, shared namespace with expand/run phases and more. In this version, standard build process(./configure && make) and MSVC solution build both binary which "mosh" is for previous psyntax based runtime and "nmosh" is for nmosh runtime.

    * Configure script now supports out-of-tree building. 
    * updated library
      * (irregex) : 0.8.1 (Alex Shinn's irregex library)
      * (mosh process) : Added "exec"
    * new library
      * (shorten) : the shorten formed lambda like Gauche
        * (^a (+ 1 a)) == (lambda (a) (+ 1 a)) etc.
      * (rnrs load) : ERR5RS load (nmosh only)
    * BoehmGC: MIPS32 processor support.
    * MSVC build now depends on MPIR instead of GMP.
      * Download MPIR from http://www.mpir.org and extract to win/mpir. mosh.sln will load and build them together.
      * Note that building MPIR will require yasm installed. see
      * MPIR's own document (mpir/build.vc9/readme.txt) for detail.
    * Bug fixes.
      * Fixed Issue 141 reported by mrc.mgg: Profiler(-p) no longer causes sporadic SEGVs while startup.
      * Fixed Issue 140 reported by mrc.mgg: R6RS write now uses normal write procedure instead of SRFI-38 printer introduced in 0.2.4.
      * Fixed Issue 136 reported by Will.Donnelly: (mosh process) library now exports exec procedure among its friends.
